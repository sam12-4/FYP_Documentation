What Is Left for Hardware Implementation
Movement Control:

Fine-tuning motor control for smooth and precise movements (forward, backward, left, right).
Implement obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors.
Camera Integration:

Completing the setup for the ESP32-CAM to transmit live video to the app.
Ensuring real-time image capture and streaming without significant latency.
Dust Collection Mechanism:

Testing and improving the efficiency of the fan and dustbin mechanisms.
Ensuring proper alignment and sealing to avoid dust leaks.
Battery Management:

Testing the battery performance and ensuring sufficient power for motors, sensors, and ESP32 during prolonged operation.
Implementing a charging system, if necessary.
PCB Design:

Designing a compact PCB to house all connections for neatness and scalability.
Final Assembly:

Combining all components into a stable, user-friendly chassis.
Testing for durability and overall performance.
Parallel Approach for Hardware Completion
Subsystem Teams: Work on motors, sensors, and ESP32 separately in parallel to save time.

Team A: Movement Control (Motors + Ultrasonic Sensors).
Team B: Camera Integration (ESP32-CAM).
Team C: Dust Collection Mechanism.
Prototyping While Developing: Begin assembling a working prototype while testing individual components.

Simultaneous Testing: Perform integrated testing of components (e.g., motor movements and sensor feedback) while refining separate subsystems.

Easy Approach to Streamline Hardware
Use pre-built libraries for motor control, ultrasonic sensors, and camera modules to reduce development time.
Rely on pre-made robot chassis kits to avoid designing the structure from scratch.
Focus on essential features first (e.g., basic movement, obstacle avoidance) and add advanced features (e.g., image recognition) later.
Steps to Control Robot Movements with ESP32
Set Up Motor Driver:

Use an L298N or similar motor driver to control DC motors.
Connect the motor driver to the ESP32 GPIO pins for direction and speed control.
Write Movement Control Code:

Use PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to control motor speed.
Define functions for movement, such as moveForward(), moveBackward(), turnLeft(), and turnRight().
Integrate Sensor Feedback:

Use the ultrasonic sensor to provide real-time distance measurements.
Implement obstacle detection logic to stop or reroute the robot if an obstacle is detected.
Deploy Movement Model:

Flash your ESP32 with the final code containing movement logic.
Use a remote-control interface via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to send commands to the ESP32.
Test Movements:

Use basic test scenarios to validate movement in an open space.
Gradually introduce obstacles to refine the obstacle-avoidance algorithm.
Example Code for ESP32 Movement Control
cpp
Copy code
#include <Arduino.h>

#define motor1Pin1 14
#define motor1Pin2 12
#define motor2Pin1 27
#define motor2Pin2 26
#define speedPin 25 // PWM pin for speed control

#define trigPin 5
#define echoPin 18

void setup() {
  pinMode(motor1Pin1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor1Pin2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor2Pin1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor2Pin2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(speedPin, OUTPUT);

  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
}

void moveForward() {
  digitalWrite(motor1Pin1, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(motor1Pin2, LOW);
  digitalWrite(motor2Pin1, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(motor2Pin2, LOW);
}

void moveBackward() {
  digitalWrite(motor1Pin1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(motor1Pin2, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(motor2Pin1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(motor2Pin2, HIGH);
}

void stopMotors() {
  digitalWrite(motor1Pin1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(motor1Pin2, LOW);
  digitalWrite(motor2Pin1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(motor2Pin2, LOW);
}

void loop() {
  // Example: Move forward for 2 seconds, then stop
  moveForward();
  delay(2000);
  stopMotors();
}
This is a basic framework. You can integrate real-time feedback from the ultrasonic sensor for autonomous movement.

Next Steps
Prioritize hardware tests with specific goals for each session (e.g., obstacle avoidance, camera feed).
Gradually integrate hardware with the app to ensure seamless functionality.
Document each step for presentation and debugging purposes.
